# Summary
Efficient and accurate flood simulation is increasingly important to human society as climate keeps changing and floods of all magnitudes seem to occur more frequent. Two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models, replacing one-dimensional (1D) models, have become the work horse for most academic research and engineering purposes in practice. Many agencies, such as U.S. DOT, Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), FEMA, and U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (USACE), have developed and promoted 2D hydraulic models to fulfill their respective missions. Example 2D models are SRH-2D (USBR) and HEC-RAS 2D (USACE). Over the past several decades, these models have been greatly improved by their respective agencies independently. However, limitations still exist in these individual models. For example, it is desirable to have fair and meaningful model result inter-comparison. But due to the differences in numerical schemes and model approximations, such comparison is currently difficult, if not impossible. Another example of limitation is that most of these models evolved from legacy codes. They lack the flexibility to cope with the rapidly evolving landscape of computational science and utilize the power of modern computational ecosystems such as Python and R. 

`pyHMT2D` is a Python package developed to partially remove these limitations. It stands for "2D Hydraulic Modeling Tools with Python". Objected-oriented programming is utilized to encapsulate the hydraulic models and simulation data (Fig. 1). The whole package is made of three submodules, namely `Calibration`, `Hydraulic_Models_Data`, and `Misc`. A user only needs to interface with `pyHMT2D` using the high-level APIs implemented in a handful of classes in the package. In addition to these core classes, `pyHMT2D` also provides a suite of miscellaneous tools to perform various tasks essential to hydraulic modeling tasks, such as creation and manipulation of geo-referenced terrain data. To compare model results and provide an alternative visualization means, VTK [@vtkbook2006] is used as a common format. `pyHMT2D` can read results from all supported hydraulic models and translates them to VTK. Results in VTK format can be opened in ParaView [@Ayachit2015] for visualization and further analysis. Another feature that makes `pyHMT2D`more attractive is the use of Python as a "glue" language to expose all supported hydraulic models to the large amount of powerful optimization packages. It can facilitate automatic and more intelligent model calibrations. In summary, `pyHMT2D` can be used to control and (semi)automate 2D hydraulic modeling, pre-/post-processing simulation results, convert simulation results into the unified format of VTK [@vtkbook2006] and automatic calibration.

# Statement of need

Floods are one of the most common natural hazards which affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide and cost billions of dollars in damage. In the United States, about 40\% of recorded 35,000 disasters since 1900 were major floods and related storms [@Cigler2017]. With
climate change, floods are becoming more frequent and severe. To better understand the dynamics of floods and mitigate their impact, hydraulic models have been used extensively. In engineering practice, hydraulic models are also widely used to design and evaluate infrastructure, such as bridges and roads, against the damaging effect of flowing water. Flow in rivers and streams is naturally three-dimensional. However, it is computationally prohibitive to simulate three-dimensional flow field for large scale applications.   Two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic modeling is the prevailing approach for both engineering practice and research. Many 2D models exist and the fundamental physical governing equations implemented are very similar. Indeed, the depth-averaged shallow water equations are the backbone of most 2D hydraulic simulation models [@Liu2008]. However, different 2D hydraulic models have their own unique numerical scheme, mesh and result format, and even some variations to the governing equations. The diverse, isolated, and most time incompatible ecosystems surrounding these models can create problems. 

Due to the importance of 2D hydraulic models to the society for flood prediction, prevention, mitigation, and engineering design of infrastructure, there is a great need to make them comparable. In addition, as for all other computational models, there is a persistent need to make them more efficient, easy to use, automatic to be calibrated. Therefore, the motivations of developing `pyHMT2D` are as follows:

- One major motivation is to efficiently and automatically run 2D hydraulic modeling simulations, for example, batch simulations to intelligently and efficiently calibrate models. Many of the 2D models have some automation to certain degree. However, these models and their GUIs are closed source. Therefore, a modeler is limited to what he/she can do. Automated calibration using the Python code in `pyHMT2D` also makes it possible for these models to better ingest vast amount of data generated by millions of sensors deployed in the field.
- `pyHMT2D` also serves as a bridge between 2D hydraulic models and the Python universe where many powerful libraries exist, for example statistics, optimization, machine learning, GIS, and parallel computing.
- `pyHMT2D` can make model inter-comparison and evaluation an easy task. Almost all 2D hydraulic models solve the shallow-water equations. However, every model does it differently. How these differences manifest in their results and how to quantify/interpret the differences are of great interest to practitioners.
- The read/write and transformation of 2D hydraulic model results can be used to feed other models which use the simulated flow field, for example external water quality models and fish migration models.
- Most 2D models have good user interface and they have the capability to produce good result visualizations and analysis. However, with `pyHMT2D` and the power of the VTK library, 2D hydraulic modeling results can be visualized and analyzed with more flexibility and efficiency.

Previously, tools have been developed to control hydraulic models and process their simulation results. Most of these existing tools use similar scripting languages, such as VBA, Matlab, and Python. For example, @MoyaQuirogaEtAl2013 showed the evaluation of HEC-RAS modeling uncertainties with the combination of Delphi, VB.NET, and Windows command line batch scripts. In @Goodell2014 and its companion code, VBA was used to interact with HEC-RAS and a variety of demonstration examples were provided. @LeonGoodell2016 developed several MATLAB scripts for controlling HEC-RAS, which include input file reading and writing, output file reading, plotting, and parallel computation. Similar implementation using Python has been reported in @Dysarz2018. If one searches on GitHub with the keyword "HEC-RAS", there are many repositories and code snippets which also implement certain functionality mentioned above and they are for one particular model only. However, `pyHMT2D` is designed to be more general and extensible. The class hierarchy shown in Fig. 1 can easily add other hydraulic models into `pyHMT2D`. Model inter-comparison functionality is also missing in existing tools.  

# Functionality

`pyHMT2D` requires the user to have some basic knowledge about Python programming, which is easy to acquire because of Python's intuitiveness. And of course, the user should have knowledge on how to operate the particular 2D hydraulic models that he/she wants to use `pyHMT2D` for. For most of the functionality, the user needs to first create a simulation case using a 2D hydraulic model, run the case, and obtain some results. The creation of a simulation case from scratch with `pyHMT2D` is currently not supported. 

### Basic Functionality

In general, the basic functionality of `pyHMT2D` is to read simulation results, convert to different format, and control simulation runs. Specifically, for SRH-2D modeling:

-  read SRH-2D results (mainly into Python's Numpy arrays) through the `SRH_2D_Data` class.
-  convert SRH-2D results to VTK format, one of the most popular formats for
   scientific data. The conversion is through the `SRH_2D_Data` class and the VTK library.
   
   -  point and cell center data (water, depth, water surface elevation,
      velocity, and all other solution variables from SRH-2D)
   -  interpolate between point and cell data

-  sample and probe simulation results in the converted VTK format with the VTK library.
-  control and modify SRH-2D simulations through the `SRH_2D_Model` class.

For HEC-RAS 2D modeling, the basic functionality includes

-  read HEC-RAS 2D results in HDF files (mainly into Python's Numpy arrays) through the `RAS_2D_Data` class.
-  convert HEC-RAS 2D results to VTK format through the `RAS_2D_Data` class and the VTK library. In addition to the similar functions as SRH-2D, the `RAS_2D_Data` class can also out the following

   -  face data (e.g., subterrain data), which is one of the features of HEC-RAS.

-  convert HEC-RAS 2D mesh, boundary conditions, and Manningâ€™s roughness $n$ data into SRH-2D format such that SRH-2D and HEC-RAS 2D can run a case with exactly the same mesh for fair comparison. Additionally, with `pyHMT2D`, HEC-RAS 2D can be used as a mesh generator for SRH-2D.
-  sample and probe simulation results in the converted VTK format with the VTK library.
-  control and modify HEC-RAS 2D simulations through the `HEC_RAS_Model` class. The control is through the Python library pywin32 [@hammond2000] to interface with HEC-RAS through the Component Object Model (COM), which is the foundation for Microsoft's OLE and ActiveX technologies. 

As an example of the basic functionality, Fig. 2 shows the comparison of simulated water depth from SRH-2D and HEC-RAS in ParaView using the `pyHMT2D` package. The case was first created and simulated in HEC-RAS. Then the HEC-RAS result was read in with the `RAS_2D_Data` class, converted to VTK format and to SRH-2D mesh format. SRH-2D was invoked to run the converted case, whose result was then converted to VTK too. Both VTK results from HEC-RAS and SRH-2D were loaded into ParaView for comparison.

### Advanced Functionality

Advanced functionality of `pyHMT2D` is built upon its basic functionality. With the control capability above, it is possible to
perform the following tasks among many others:

-  automatic calibration of models with available optimization and calibration Python packages. Currently, `scipy`'s `optimize` module is supported, which includes many local and global optimization methods. The automatic calibration is mainly through the `Calibration` submodule, which includes five major classes, namely `Calibrator`, `Optimizer`, `Parameters`, `Objectives`, and `Measurements`. The last three classes are in fact containers which have a list of objects of `Parameter`, `Objective`, and `Measurement` classes, respectively (Fig. 1). The configuration of a calibration task is specified in a JSON file, which contains information on which model to run, simulation case, calibration parameters, objectives (cost or error function), which optimizer to use and its configuration. 
-  Monte-Carlo simulations with scripting and Pythonâ€™s statistic libraries. This is useful for uncertainty analysis.

To demonstrate the automatic calibration functionality, Fig. 3 shows a simple, yet complete, example which is the river water surface profile in a 10 km long river. This example is located in the "examples/calibration" directory of the repository on GitHub. The channel is divided into to segments, each of which has their own calibration parameter (the Manning's roughness $n$ in this case). Fig. 3(a) shows the layout of the case and the simulated profile using the simple `Backwater-1D` class. This result is used as a manufactured solution. Four sampling points are shown in Fig. 1(a), which are used to sample results as measurement data. Then the `Calibrator` is constructed and the calibration uses `scipy.optimize`'s "Nelder-Mead" method. Fig. 3 (b) shows the trajectory of the calibration in the parameter space and Fig. 3(c) shows the calibration error as a function of iteration number. At the end, the calibration succeed and the two calibration parameters $n_1$ and $n_2$ are very close to the true values.

In addition to the basic and advanced functionalities, other useful features are as follows:

-  calculate the difference between simulation results (regardless they are on the same mesh or not). This can be done through the `vtkHandler` class in the `Misc` submodule. 
-  create and manipulate georeferenced terrain data for 2D modeling. This can be done through the `Terrain` class in the `Misc` submodule.
-  conversion of SRH-2D model mesh and result to 3D through extrusion (one layer or multiple layers) and
   VTK interpolation. This can be done through the `SRH_2D_Data` class. This feature is useful to use 2D simulation result in 3D applications, e.g., fish passage design or use 2D result as initial condition for 3D simulations. Currently, conversion
   to `OpenFOAM` [@openfoam2021] is supported through `Gmsh`'s MSH file format [@Geuzaine2009].


# Dependencies

`pyHMT2D`'s  core functionality relies the following Python packages: h5py [@collette2013], VTK [@vtkbook2006], GDAL [@gdal2020], NumPy [@harris2020], and Matplotlib [@hunter2007]. Optionally, pywin32 [@hammond2000] is needed to control the simulation of HEC-RAS and affine [@Gillies2014] is needed to read HEC-RAS results.

`pyHMT2D` was developed as a tool box for several past and ongoing research projects in the author's research group. Though `pyHMT2D` did not directly receive financial support from these projects nor it was in any of these projects' workscope, `pyHMT2D` did benefit from the knowledge on various aspects of 2D hydraulic models accumulated through these projects.
