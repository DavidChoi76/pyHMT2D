# Summary
Flooding  Two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic modeling, replacing one-dimensional (1D) modeling, has become the work horse for most engineering purposes in practice. Many agencies, such as U.S. DOT, Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), FEMA, and U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (USACE), have developed and promoted 2D hydraulic models to fulfill their respective missions. Example 2D models are SRH-2D (USBR) and HEC-RAS 2D (USACE). 

SWEs are the backbone of most flood simulation models [@Liu2008].


# Statement of need


# Functionality


### Basic Functionality


### Advanced Functionality


# Dependencies

`pyHMT2D` relies on functionality from the following Python packages: GDAL [@gdal2020], NumPy [@harris2020], Matplotlib [@hunter2007].

# Acknowledgements

I thank Dr. Yong Lai at U.S. Bureaul of Relcamation and Scott Hogan at U.S. Federal Highway Administration for their valuable knowledge and suggestions regarding SRH-2D. I also thank Gary Brunner from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for his time answering my questions regarding HEC-RAS.

`pyHMT2D` was developed as a tool box for several past and ongoing research projects in our group. Though `pyHMT2D` did not direclty receive finacial support from these projects nor it is in the workscope, `pyHMT2D` did benefit from the knowledge on various aspects of 2D hydraulic models accumulated through these projects.
